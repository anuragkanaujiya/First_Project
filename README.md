It's my first project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I also used GSAP to create a smooth scrolling effect on a background video, with help from YouTube Tutorials.
Some of the effects were implemented with the help of ChatGPT.
This webpage is not responsive yet, but I will make it responsive in the future.
I'm proud that I completed this project, and I believe in myself â€” I will continue to improve and grow.
